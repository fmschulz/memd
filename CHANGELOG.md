## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- Shared local HTTP daemon support for multi-session MCP access.
- Structured task and artifact workflows for progress tracking, evidence capture, review, and thread-level collaboration.
- Summary-first project briefs, task resumes, and failure, decision, evidence, and highlight digests.
- Additional MCP tools for context retrieval, structural code queries, and debug inspection.

### Changed
- Retrieval can widen by `project_id` across older local tenant histories when needed.
- The release surface and bundled skill assets are aligned with the current `main` branch.

### Fixed
- Search-style retrieval now skips unreadable finalized chunks instead of aborting on CRC-related storage errors.
